# DP-Mass-Upgrader
This script provides the ability to upgrade multiple DPs at once.

## How the script works:
-	The script will read an excel file containing all the necessary information, DP IP, platform, version, image filename.
-	The script will generate upgrade passwords for all devices automatically, devices must be under support contract.
-	The script will start the upgrade process with a concurrency between 1-5, meaning 1-5 DPs can be upgraded in parallel.
-	The script will monitor the upgrade status of each device, if there is an error it will print it with the reason.
-	The script will print a summary of Success/Failure for each DP.

## Prerequisites:
1.	Python3 installed on the client with the following modules:  
    -	Pandas  
    -	requests  
    -	urllib3  
    -	openpyxl
2.	The client running the script must be connected to the internet.


## Usage:
1.	python3 dp_mass_upgrader.py [Vision-IP] [Vision-user] [Vision-pass] [Excel-filename] [1-5]
    - Vision-IP: IP of the Vision that manages the DPs
    - Vision-user: Vision login username
    - Vision-pass: Vision login password
    - Excel-filename: Name of the excel file with the information
    - <1-5>: Number of simultaneous upgrades
2.  The folder containing the script should also contain the following:
    - Excel file with all the relevant information: IP, platform, version, image filename
    - The image file used for the upgrade  
3. Excel formatting notes: 
    - The platform name in the Excel file must be exactly as it appears in the ‘Supported Platform’ column of the Excel file
    - The version number in the Excel file must be in the format of x.x.x.x for example: 8.30.0.0, 8.26.2.0 etc.
    - A template Excel file can be found in the repository

## Example of running the script from a Linux server:

$ python3 dp_mass_upgrader.py 10.10.10.10 radware radware example.xlsx 3
